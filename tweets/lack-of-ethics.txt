About the complete lack of ethics in natural sciences.
Example: Switzerland - How to make it.

Switzerland: 
Federal states - Kantone - like in USA, just much much more tiny. Everybody knows everybody.

Now, Universities:

TWO TYPES.

a)
Federal: ETH Zurich, ETH Lausanne pi pa po #PSI #WSL #AWEL BLAH.
Meaning, ETH is paid by #BUND #COUNTRY #TAX.
Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule.
Eidgenossen.
Schweiz.
Gemeingut.

b)
KANTONAL - Per CANTON: UNI Zürich.
Paid by #CANTON #ZURICH #TAX.
Universität.

Now some fun facts.

- In Germany, there is Uni(versity) and #FH #Fachhochschule 
- German UNI degree > FH degree (less time wasted, more practical)
- Swiss ETH GOD > UNI Master

Back to TOPIC ETHICS.

UNI Zürich has languages and human studies.
ETH wants to be left alone. Science. Numbers. Natural sciences.

Both compete, try to find contacts in #Wirtschaft #economy.
#Lobbyism grows. Secrecy is REQUIRED to remain COMPETETIVE.

In my view this is sick.

It gives ETH students a excuse draft to say:
We weren't lectured ethics - so I forgot about my responsibilites, sorry.

This may be an incomplete picture, with errors. But worth discussion.
It would explain complete desinterest in #FreeAssange topic in this society.
