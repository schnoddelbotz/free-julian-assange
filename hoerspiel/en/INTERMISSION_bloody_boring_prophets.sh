say -v $HARRY "No. Hang on. I've got it here somewhere."

say -v $BRIAN "That's all right. That's four for the gourd."

say -v $HARRY "Four? For this gourd? Four?! Look at it. It's worth ten if it's worth a shekel."

say -v $BRIAN "But you just gave it to me for nothing."

say -v $HARRY "Yes, but it's worth ten!"

say -v $BRIAN "All right. All right."

say -v $HARRY "No, no, no, no. It's not worth ten. You're supposed to argue, 'Ten for that? You must be mad!' Ohh, well. sniff One born every minute."

say "This was funny."
